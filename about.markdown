Hi, My name is Dina. I'm a software engineer/AI researcher/archaeologist. I'm currently studying a PhD at the University of Sydney, where I'm looking at ensemble-based approaches for improving the performance of low precision neural networks. You can find my research portfolio [here](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/research-students/dinakazemibeidokhti-kazemibeidokhti-671.html).  

I helped develop a new method for detecting liver cancer using deep learning as a 2023 [CSIRO/Pawsey intern](https://pawsey.org.au/alumni/). Alhtough this was my first time working with vision transformers, I completely got why everyone in the field is so hyped up about them. This project and Dr House are the reasons I'm considering going into biomedical engineering sometime in the future.  
 
I have experience working as a software engineer, developing and designing new components to help data engineers and scientists run AI experiments on an in-house platform, and deploying software infrastructure on AWS with terraform.  

As an undergrad, I got a double degree in software engineering and archaeology. My attempt at combing the two manifested in the form of a few archaeological projects such as [this](https://sciences.ucf.edu/anthropology/kerkenes/) and [this](https://nauticalarch.org/projects/cape-gelidonya-late-bronze-age-shipwreck-excavation/) where I developed programs to analyse ancient artifacts and remote sensing images. 

I have a special [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5BfSIIFLNbveywBgmaYdy9?si=089ad7d7cbbd4467) on Spotify, "Cinematic Coding", which I use to carry me through those coding moments that need a bit of inspiration.

This blog is for showcasing my research findings and personal projects, hope you find them useful. If you'd like to get in touch, please connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dina-kazemi-beidokhti-309187167/) and/or [GitHub](https://github.com/dinakazemi).
